# üöÜ SNCF Low Fares 2024 ‚Äì Data Sprint (*academic project*)

Data analysis project on SNCF open datasets, focusing on the geography of trains fares in France (TGV INOUI & OUIGO).  
Includes data cleaning, feature engineering (distance, regions), and visualizations to compare average fares per kilometre across French regions.  

---

## 1 - Objective
Measure how SNCF fares vary geographically by calculating the average fare per kilometre (‚Ç¨/km) by destination region, and identify which destinations are the most and least affordable.  

## 2 - Data Sources

- **Main dataset**: [Tarifs TGV INOUI & OUIGO](https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/tarifs-tgv-inoui-ouigo/table/)  
  - 15,570 rows  
  - 9 columns (Transporter, Origin Station, UIC code, Destination Station, Class, Fare Profile, Min Price, Max Price)  
  - Provides price ranges (min/max) per route and fare profile (Normal, Student, Regulated)   

- **Additional datasets**:  
  - SNCF ‚ÄúVoyager Stations‚Äù dataset (station metadata and regions)  
  - SNCF ‚ÄúCO‚ÇÇ Emissions‚Äù dataset (distances between stations + price/km)  
  - [Atlas GeoJSON](https://france-geojson.gregoiredavid.fr/) (regional boundaries for mapping)

## 3 - Methodology

**Corpus preparation**  
- Converted SNCF fares into fare per kilomtre
- Merged with station metadata to link each destination station to its region. Added columns from external datasets:  
  - *Region Name* (from SNCF station locations dataset)  
  - *Fare per km* (from CO‚ÇÇ emissions dataset)  
  - *Geopoint* (lat/long from station dataset)  
  - *Geo_shape* (regional polygons from GeoJSON)  

**Analysis & visualization**  
- Map stations geographically and associate each with a region  
- Retrieve regional boundaries via GeoJSON  
- Compute average **fare per km per by destination region**  
- Rank regions from most to least expensive

## 4 - Results
‚Ä¢	Clear regional differences by destination:
	‚Ä¢	Trips to Hauts-de-France, √éle-de-France, Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes are the most expensive (‚âà 0.26 ‚Ç¨/km).
	‚Ä¢	Trips to Pays de la Loire, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© are the least expensive (< 0.20 ‚Ç¨/km).

  **Key visualizations:**

## 5 - Discussion

The observed regional disparities (‚âà ‚Ç¨0.09/km between cheapest and most expensive destinations) confirm that SNCF fares ares not driven only by distance. 
As Finez (2014) shows, pricing results from a shift towards yield management, where fares adapt to demand.
Similarly, Alet (2009) highlights the opacity of SNCF pricing, which conceals marked territorials inequalities. 
Our results reflect this: high-demand regions (√éle-de-France, Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes) are structurally more expensive, while others remain more affordable.

## 6 - Next Steps
- Extend analysis with a temporal dimension (evolution of fares over time)  
- Compare SNCF fares with other transport modes (bus, car, plane)  
- Explore sociological implications of regional fare inequalities (urban vs rural)
